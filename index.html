      <p id="text">The Paleolithic Era (also known as the Stone Age) started from the first emergence of humans and ended about 3,000 B.C.E. when civilizations started to create
      written languages. During this period Humans began to develop stone tools, and mostly roamed in packs as nomads hunting and gathering food as they went. This
      was also the time when humans began to travel all across the world, originating in Africa and spreading from there. Much of what is known of this period is
      from archeological finds since there was not written history. The emergence of civilizations brought on the development of better techniques to forge metal
      tools and weaponry, thus ending the utility of Stone tools and ushering the beginning of Ancient History, the Bronze Age.</p>
