# DoomsdayClock
The Doomsday Clock is a concept developed to have a relatable concept of how close or far we are to the end of humanity.

I was inspired to work on this project after having recently read about the clock moving forward to 11:57:30 with the recent rise
of nationalism.

At the top of the page, there is a button that jumps the clock forward or backward to the significant periods of Humanity. The slider
beneath the clock also works and in a way better represents what the clock is supposed to show - the short time that we as a society
have really existed.
